# WhoseDis! Lite Public Source Code
Simple base version of WhoseDis! app.

## Description

Fun project for keeping track of "what belongs to whom", or just stored amounts of things that might have a barcode or QR-Code.

## Vision

This is purely made from the vision of sharing a house or apartment and therefore, a fridge, cellar or pantry.
Keeping track of "what belongs to whom" is paramount to avoid conflict and headaches so... What if instead of just dividing sections for each person you could just scan the product that you intend to use and see, if its yours, if not, if you can use it ... You get the idea right? :D
